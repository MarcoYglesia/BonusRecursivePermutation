# BonusRecursivePermutation

Here is my thoughts on this, using the PowerPoint and some info I got from youtube videos to help me understand Recursive Permuation better this is what I came up with. I did the switch function as you showed in the PowerPoint and did my function called "recursivePermutation". From what I could understand it was just swapping the indexes around until you exausted all sets and sinces its recursive we call the function inside of itself!
